# Search the Times

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the New York Times Search app, implemented with React, and built as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the app
You can use the app online at Heroku eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This app is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed when it's complete, and will not be available.
